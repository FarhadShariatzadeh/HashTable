My name is Sima Sheibani.

- resources: I used only the resources which was provided in the instruction and the lecture code.
  They were more than enough.

- This assignment was pretty hard for me. I had to spend almost 30 hours!!! 

- I like this assignment because I could solve my problem quicker compare to previous assignments.

- I suggest to use smaller word.txt for the next time. It was headach to work with the main word.txt.
